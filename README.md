# Tic Tac Toe Tic

A variant of Tic Tac Toe implemented by Will Fowlkes, and designed by a friend of his.

## Rules

* You start with a 4 by 4 grid and must get 4 in a row to win.
* On your turn, you may either place a piece of your color or expand the board in any direction. These board expansions will add a new row or new column to the board.

## Building

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`.
* Run Grunt with `grunt` to concat all the source files together into
  `tttt.js`.
